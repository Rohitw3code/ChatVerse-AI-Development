# GraphInterrupt Handling Fix & Dynamic Login Tool Detection

## Problem
The `login_to_gmail` tool was being called but a `GraphInterrupt` exception was being caught and treated as an error:
```
‚ùå Error executing login_to_gmail: GraphInterrupt - (Interrupt(value={'name': 'gmail_error', 'type': 'connect', ...
```

This caused the authentication flow to fail instead of properly handling the user interaction.

## Root Cause
1. `GraphInterrupt` is **not an error** - it's an intentional pause for user interaction (OAuth flow)
2. The code was catching it as a generic exception and formatting it as an error
3. Tool names were hardcoded (e.g., 'verify_gmail_connection', 'instagram_auth_verification')

## Solution ‚úÖ

### 1. Proper GraphInterrupt Handling
```python
except Exception as e:
    # Check if it's a GraphInterrupt (user interaction needed)
    if type(e).__name__ == 'GraphInterrupt':
        # Treat as success - this is expected for login flows
        out = "Connection flow initiated. Please complete the authentication process."
        print(f"\n\n‚úÖ GraphInterrupt detected - user interaction required (this is expected)")
```

### 2. Dynamic Login Tool Detection (No Hardcoding)
```python
# Find login/connection tools dynamically
login_tools = []
for tool_name in tools.keys():
    tool_lower = tool_name.lower()
    if any(keyword in tool_lower for keyword in ['login', 'connect', 'error', 'auth']):
        # Skip verification tools, prefer actual login/error tools
        if 'verify' not in tool_lower and 'verification' not in tool_lower:
            login_tools.append(tool_name)

if login_tools:
    tools_list = "', '".join(login_tools)
    out = f"{out}\n\nüí° Hint: Call one of these tools to reconnect: '{tools_list}'"
```

### 3. Enhanced System Prompt
```
AUTHENTICATION & CONNECTION HANDLING:
- If ANY tool returns a message containing 'not connected', 'not authenticated', or 'account is not connected', 
  you MUST immediately look for a login/connection tool (tool name containing 'login', 'connect', or 'error') 
  and call it with the error message as parameter.
- DO NOT just respond with the error message. ALWAYS try the login tool first.
- If no login tool exists, then respond with: 'Need to login first'
- After calling the login tool, wait for the result before proceeding.
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario: Gmail Not Connected

**Before Fix:**
```
1. verify_gmail_connection returns: "Gmail account is not connected"
2. LLM calls: login_to_gmail
3. GraphInterrupt raised (for OAuth flow)
4. ‚ùå Error: "Error executing login_to_gmail: GraphInterrupt"
5. Flow stops, user can't connect
```

**After Fix:**
```
1. verify_gmail_connection returns: "Gmail account is not connected
   üí° Hint: Call one of these tools to reconnect: 'login_to_gmail'"
2. LLM calls: login_to_gmail
3. GraphInterrupt raised (for OAuth flow)
4. ‚úÖ Detected as expected: "Connection flow initiated. Please complete the authentication process."
5. User sees OAuth prompt
6. User connects account
7. Flow resumes
8. Original task completed
```

## Key Changes

### 1. GraphInterrupt Detection
- **Type check**: `type(e).__name__ == 'GraphInterrupt'`
- **Treated as success**: Returns positive message instead of error
- **Console logging**: Shows "‚úÖ GraphInterrupt detected" for debugging

### 2. Dynamic Tool Discovery
**Detects login tools by searching for keywords in tool names:**
- `login` (e.g., `login_to_gmail`)
- `connect` (e.g., `connect_instagram`)
- `error` (e.g., `instagram_error`, `gmail_error`)
- `auth` (e.g., `authenticate_service`)

**Filters out verification tools:**
- Skips tools with `verify` or `verification` in name
- Prefers actual login/error tools over read-only verification

### 3. Generic Hints
```python
# Old (hardcoded):
'verify_gmail_connection': 'verify_gmail_connection',
'instagram_auth_verification': 'instagram_auth_verification'

# New (dynamic):
for tool_name in tools.keys():
    if 'login' in tool_name.lower() or 'error' in tool_name.lower():
        login_tools.append(tool_name)
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **GraphInterrupt handled correctly** - No longer treated as error  
‚úÖ **No hardcoded agent names** - Works with any agent  
‚úÖ **No hardcoded tool names** - Automatically finds login tools  
‚úÖ **Platform agnostic** - Works for Gmail, Instagram, YouTube, etc.  
‚úÖ **Extensible** - New agents with login tools work automatically  
‚úÖ **Clear messaging** - User knows authentication is in progress  
‚úÖ **Debug friendly** - Console shows GraphInterrupt detection  

## Example Output

### When authentication needed:
```
Tool: verify_gmail_connection
Output: "Gmail account is not connected

üí° Hint: Call one of these tools to reconnect: 'login_to_gmail'"
```

### When login tool called:
```
Tool: login_to_gmail
Output: "Connection flow initiated. Please complete the authentication process."
Console: ‚úÖ GraphInterrupt detected - user interaction required (this is expected)
```

### Multiple login tools available:
```
üí° Hint: Call one of these tools to reconnect: 'login_to_gmail', 'instagram_error', 'youtube_connect'
```

## Testing

Start the server and test:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001
```

1. Disconnect Gmail account
2. Ask: "fetch the recent emails"
3. Should see: Agent calls verify_gmail_connection ‚Üí Gets "not connected" ‚Üí Calls login_to_gmail ‚Üí GraphInterrupt handled ‚Üí User connects ‚Üí Emails fetched ‚úÖ

## Console Output to Look For

```
‚úÖ GraphInterrupt detected - user interaction required (this is expected)
```

This confirms the fix is working!
