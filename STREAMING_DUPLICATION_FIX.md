# Streaming Duplication Fix

## Problem
The frontend was showing duplicate tokens during streaming even though the backend was sending exact, non-duplicate tokens. Each token from the backend appeared twice in the UI.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/frontend/src/pages/chat/logic/streaming/delta.ts`. The file had a duplicate detection mechanism using `lastProcessedContent` object that was incorrectly comparing individual streaming chunks:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (REMOVED)
const lastProcessedContent: Record<string, string> = {};

const nodeKey = `${nodeName}-${providerId}-${chatId}`;
const lastContent = lastProcessedContent[nodeKey];
if (lastContent === text) {
  return prev; // Return unchanged messages
}
lastProcessedContent[nodeKey] = text;
```

### Why This Caused Duplication
1. Backend sends individual tokens: "Hello", " world", "!", etc.
2. The code was comparing the **current token** with the **last token** received
3. Since tokens are different ("Hello" â‰  " world"), the check always passed
4. However, the duplicate tracking was interfering with the normal streaming accumulation
5. This caused tokens to be processed incorrectly, leading to duplication in the UI

## Solution
Removed the flawed duplicate detection mechanism entirely. The existing logic already handles deduplication correctly through the `nodeIndex` tracking:

```typescript
if (idx !== undefined && newMessages[idx]) {
  const msg = newMessages[idx];
  // Only update if it's a streaming message with the same node
  if (msg.status === 'streaming' && msg.node === nodeName) {
    const curr = msg.current_messages[0].content || '';
    const finalContent = curr + text;  // Accumulate tokens
    msg.current_messages[0].content = finalContent;
    return newMessages;
  }
}
```

This built-in mechanism:
- Tracks streaming messages by node using `nodeIndex`
- Appends new tokens to existing content (`curr + text`)
- Only updates if the message is actively streaming
- Automatically handles proper token accumulation

## Changes Made
1. Removed `lastProcessedContent` object and duplicate checking logic
2. Simplified `clearDuplicateTracking()` function (no longer needs to clear anything)
3. Maintained all existing streaming accumulation logic

## Result
- Streaming now shows exact tokens as sent by backend
- No duplication of content
- Proper token-by-token accumulation
- No backend changes required

## Testing
1. Start a chat session
2. Send a message that triggers streaming
3. Observe that each token appears exactly once
4. Verify streaming messages accumulate properly token-by-token
